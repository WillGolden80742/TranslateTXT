##TranslateTXT


## Description

This project harnesses the power of the Google Translate API to seamlessly translate text from a source language to a target language. The translation process is facilitated by a Python script that reads text from a specified file, performs the translation, and stores the translated text in a new file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Google Cloud Platform Account
- Google Translate API Key (Ensure this key is added to a file named 'TRANSLATE_API_KEY' in the project directory.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   cd your-project
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. **Obtain a Google Cloud Platform API Key for the Translate API and save it in a file named 'TRANSLATE_API_KEY' in the project directory.**

## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python translate_script.py
```

1. Enter the file path of the text you wish to translate.
2. Enter the target language.

The script will then display the translation progress and save the translated text to a new file.
